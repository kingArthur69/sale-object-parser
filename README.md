# sale-object-parser
The goal of this project was to write an application that reads the
content from files with content written in different formats, but containing
similar data, and reporting that data. As the data
is similar, the content of the files may be reported using the same
interface, called “SaleObjectConsumer”

Additional points to solve:
* Make it easy for other developers to:
* * Understand and consume your API
* * Contribute further to your solution
* Structure the code in regards to Object Oriented Design
* How error prone is it?
* How easy would it be to extend it with new input formats?
